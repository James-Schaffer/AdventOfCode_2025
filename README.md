## My solutions to advent of code 2025

I have wanted to do advent of code for a few years now, often intimidated by the complexity, length and lack of faith in myself I put it off, this year I'm putting the excuses aside and giving it a go. I'm using C++ which is a language I'm currently learning (as per starting, I feel alot more confident now - James over a month later). I thought this would be a fun way of practicing C++ and finally doing an advent of code. Also, I'm doing this AI free*.

## Diary / Notes

### Day 1-7 (2/12/25-14/01/26)

The first 7 days went well, little difficulty and very much enjoyed. I struggled with some datatype and file reading but overall went well.

### 13/01/26

Adding a comment here to say despite my initial goal of no AI, I have used it occasionally to help with locating bugs in my code. C++ is relatively new to me, and so I have found this useful a couple of times.

### 20/01/26

Adding another comment here to say, up till day 8 all solutions were my own, I used no external help to design the algorythm, only some with syntax and debugging. Day 8 was alot harder, whilst a simple O(n^2) algorithm would have been straight forward I want to come up with a more efficient algorythm which would scare better with the larger datasets of Advent Of Code (note the 1000 lines of code of the puzzle input which would require 499,500 iterations just to get all the distances between the points).

### 21/01/16

I ended up going with the straightforward solution as I couldn't figure it out. Day 8 was still the hardest yet but still very fun.
